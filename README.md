Skin Test Result Analyzer

Tests for Tuberculosis or Valley Fever require placing a skin test and reading the results (as measured by induration) 48-72 hours later. Reading the tests requires expertise (reaction size measured in millimeters) and two visits - one to place and one to read the test. Both of these factorslimit the utility of the testing. Smart phone technology (camera, measurement tools, etc.) could do the accurate readings remotely and therefore avoid the second visit by the patients.
